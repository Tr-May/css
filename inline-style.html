    <h1>Full Stack Web Development</h1>
    <p>
      Full-stack web development refers to the practice of developing both the
      client-side (front end) and server-side (back end) components of a web
      application. A full-stack developer is proficient in multiple
      technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, as
      well as server-side languages, databases, and server management for the
      back end. This comprehensive skill set allows them to work on the entire
      web development process, from designing user interfaces to handling server
      logic and database interactions.
